Do `git fetch` and `git pull` to get the latest changes from the remote repository. Then, open the file in your editor and resolve the conflicts. After that, add the file to the staging area and commit it.

You can open up gitLense and see the changes made by you and the changes made by the remote repository. You can also see the changes made by you and the changes made by the remote repository in the terminal by using `git diff` command.
